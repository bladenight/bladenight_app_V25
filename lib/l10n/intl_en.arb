This information does not contain any personal data.\n\nCrash reports are only sent with your express consent. When using iOS apps, you can give consent in the app's settings or after a crash. With Android apps, when setting up the mobile device, you have the option of generally agreeing to the transmission of crash notifications to Google and the app developer.\n\nThe legal basis for data transmission is Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR.\n\nYou can revoke your consent at any time by deactivating the \"Crash reports\" function in the settings of the iOS apps (in the magazine apps the entry is in the \"Communication\" menu item).\n\nWith the Android apps, the deactivation is basically done in the Android settings.To do this, open the Settings app, select \"Google\" and there in the three-point menu at the top right the menu item \"Usage & Diagnostics\". Here you can deactivate the sending of the corresponding data. For more information, see your Google Account Help.\n\nFurther information on data protection can be found in the Firebase Crashlytics data protection information at https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy and https://docs.fabric.io/apple/fabric/data-privacy.html#data-collection-policies",
