This information does not contain any personal data.\n\nCrash reports are only sent with your express consent. When using iOS apps, you can give consent in the app's settings or after a crash. With Android apps, when setting up the mobile device, you have the option of generally agreeing to the transmission of crash notifications to Google and the app developer.\n\nThe legal basis for data transmission is Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR.\n\nYou can revoke your consent at any time by deactivating the \"Crash reports\" function in the settings of the iOS apps (in the magazine apps the entry is in the \"Communication\" menu item).\n\nWith the Android apps, the deactivation is basically done in the Android settings.To do this, open the Settings app, select \"Google\" and there in the three-point menu at the top right the menu item \"Usage & Diagnostics\".

  "about_mapbox": "Mapbox API Privacy Policy Summary\n\uD83D\uDC65 Affected: Users of the app or website overview of the BladeNight train\n\uD83E\uDD1D Purpose: Representation of the BladeNight train.\n\uD83D\uDCD3 Data processed: Data such as IP address, browser information, your operating system, content of the request, limited location and usage data\nMore details can be found below in this data protection declaration.\n\uD83D\uDCC5 Storage period: the IP address is deleted after 30 days, ID data after 36 months\n⚖\uFE0F Legal basis: Article 6 paragraph 1 lit. a GDPR (consent), Article 6 paragraph 1 lit. f GDPR (legitimate interests)\nWhat is Mapbox API?\nOn our website and app we use the Mapbox API from the American software company Mapbox Inc., 740 15th Street NW, 5th Floor, District of Columbia 20005, USA. Mapbox is an online map tool (open source mapping) that is accessed via an interface (API). By using this tool, among other things, your IP address will be forwarded to Mapbox and stored. In this data protection declaration you will learn more about the functions of the tool, why we use it and, above all, which data is stored. If you do not want this, you may not use the app.\n\nMapbox is an American software company providing custom online maps for websites. Mapbox can be used to illustrate content on our website or, for example, to graphically display directions. The maps can be easily integrated into our website/app with small code snippets (JavaScript code). Among other things, Mapbox offers a mobile-friendly environment, route information is provided in real time and data is visualized.\n\nWhy do we use Mapbox API on our website/app ?\nWe want to offer you a comprehensive service and this should not simply end with the organization of the event. \nWhat data is stored by Mapbox API?\nIf you call up one of our subpages that has an online map from Mapbox integrated, data about your user behavior can be collected and stored. This has to be so that the integrated online maps work properly. It is also possible that Mapbox will pass on data collected to third parties, but no personal data. This happens either if this is necessary for legal reasons or if Mapbox explicitly commissions another company. The map content is transmitted directly to your browser and integrated into our website or app.\n\nMapbox automatically collects certain technical information when requests are made to the APIs. In addition to your IP address, this includes browser information, your operating system, content of the request, limited location and usage data, the URL of the website visited and the date and time of the website visit. According to Mapbox, the data is only used to improve its own products. In addition, Mapbox also collects randomly generated IDs to analyze user behavior and determine the number of active users.\n\nIf you use one of our subpages and interact with an online map, Mapbox sets the following cookie in your browser:\n\nName: ppcbb-enable-content-mapbox_js\nValue: 1605795587312454386-4\nPurpose: We have not yet been able to find out more detailed information about the purpose of the cookie.\nExpiry date: after one year\n\nNote: In our tests, we did not find a cookie in the Chrome browser, but we found it in other browsers.\n\nHow long and where is data stored?\nThe data collected is stored and processed on Mapbox's American servers. For security reasons, your IP address will be kept for 30 days and then deleted. Randomly generated IDs (no personal data) that analyze the use of the APIs are deleted after 36 months.\n\nHow can I delete my data or prevent data storage?\nIf you do not want Mapbox to process data about you or your user behavior, you can disable JavaScript in your browser settings. Of course, you can then no longer use the corresponding functions to their full extent.\n\nYou have the right to access your personal data at any time and to object to its use and processing. You can manage, delete or disable cookies that may be set by Mapbox API in your browser at any time. As a result, however, the service may no longer function fully. Each browser manages, deletes or disables cookies a little differently. Under the \"Cookies\" section you will find the relevant links to the relevant instructions for the most popular browsers.\n\nlegal basis\nIf you have consented to the use of Mapbox API, the legal basis for the corresponding data processing is this consent. According to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR (consent), this consent represents the legal basis for the processing of personal data, as may occur when it is collected by Mapbox API.\n\nWe also have a legitimate interest in using Mapbox API to optimize our online service. The corresponding legal basis for this is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR (legitimate interests). However, we only use Mapbox API if you have given your consent.\n\nMapbox also processes data in the USA, among other places. We would like to point out that, according to the European Court of Justice, there is currently no adequate level of protection for data transfer to the USA. This can be associated with various risks for the legality and security of data processing.\n\nMapbox uses standard contractual clauses approved by the EU Commission (= Art. 46. Para. 2 and 3 GDPR). These clauses oblige Mapbox to comply with EU data protection standards when processing relevant data outside of the EU. These clauses are based on an implementation decision of the EU Commission. You can find the decision and the clauses here: https://germany.representation.ec.europa.eu/index_de.\n\nIf you want to learn more about how Mapbox processes data, we recommend the company's privacy policy at https://www.mapbox.com/legal/privacy.\n\nAll texts are copyrighted.\n\nSource: Created with the Privacy Generator by AdSimple\n\n",
